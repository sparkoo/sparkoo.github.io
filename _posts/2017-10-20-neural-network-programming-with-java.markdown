I've got this book for free on [Packtpub]. I was ready to dive into neural networks. I wanted to try genetic algorithms to create and learn neural networks and I hoped that this book will help me with that and introduce me to neural network insides. However, what I've got is very shallow description of few simple neural networks and how to learn them. Well, I probably should not expect I get something more for free.

I can't say that this book is bad, but I don't know who is it's target audience. I know about neural networks from high school, university and I've took few courses about machine learning on [Coursera]. It's not much, but it's enough to avoid this book and live happily without it. I hoped to get an idea how are neural networks created, how they evolve, how it's related to complex problems.

The book describes few simple cases where to use neural network, like weather forecasting, pattern recognition or classifying diseases. These cases are in almost every tutorial, book or course so nothing original here. Network modelling is usually described as "We choose this network architecture" or "We choose these as inputs", without any deeper explanation why. 

As a Java programmer, the code in the book was very hard to read and at the end useless for me as I was still focusing on mistakes in the code and not into the problem of neural networks. Next time I'll choose general book, not Java related.

As I wrote, I don't know who is this book for. Maybe someone with little theoretical knowledge about neural networks and without much experience with programming, who wants to try something practical and see some results? Maybe, but it's not me.
