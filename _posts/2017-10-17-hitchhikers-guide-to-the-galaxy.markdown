I know this number. I even used this number. I knew it is answer to the question of everything from **Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy**. However, I din't know the real meaning of it so I've decided to fix it. Of course, the answer is little different than you expected, as everything in the book by Douglas Adams.

I've got this book on christmas in edition "A Trilogy in Four Parts" in original, english language. It's over 600 pages scared me over half a year. Then I've decided to beat it.

The story starts on the Earth, but very early get's to the distant parts of the galaxy, or universe?, or totally different universe? Who knows? When you use *infinite improbability drive* you can't be sure by anything. Ingenious physics is one of the greatest thing in the *Hitchhiker's* universe. The most complicated calculations are based on the improbability and what is most improbable than waitress's bill?

The story itself is not so catchy and it's not what holds me with the book. It's the absurd humor what I like the most, despite the fact that english was a little over my skills. Sometimes I got lost in crazy descriptions and when the author was inventing new english gramatics of alien civilization, I had to stop and think what the heck I just read. Sometimes it got so crazy that I didn't knew if author is making up new words/things or if it's my lack of english vocabulary. I expect about 50/50, because dictionary was often helpless.

This humor works for me in first 2 books "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". Third book "Life, the Universe and Everything" feels a little forced and different. It's grand finale of the big story, but it doesn't work anymore. I don't know whether I was tired of the humour or the universe, or third book is really the weakest of the "trilogy". Contrariwise the fourth "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish" was a fresh, pleasant reading. Maybe because it was something little different from first three.

Do I recommend this book? Sure! It's great part of the geek history and I think that at least first book is totally worth reading. The movie is not so great, so if you're dissapointed by the movie, maybe try read a book.
